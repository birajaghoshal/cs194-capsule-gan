  <h1>Caps Lock</h1>
  <h2>Generative Adversarial Networks with Capsule Networks</h2>
  <h3> Abstract </h3>
  <p>
    In this paper, we will discuss how we leveraged a capsule network to serve as the discriminator in a Generative Adversarial
    architecture. We use our model on a variety of similar datasets in the MNIST family, hoping that the vector activations
    produced by a capsule network will be able to provide more nuanced feedback to the generator, and thus lead to better-looking
    images. We are especially interested in the situation when input images are transformed or perturbed in some way, namely
    rotations, which could especially utilize the entity-based claims of semantic understanding claimed by capsule networks.
    {include something a little more concrete about the result}</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Two recently popularized, innovative models are GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
    <dt-cite key="iangan"></dt-cite>, and CapsNets (capsule networks)
    <dt-cite key="hintoncaps"></dt-cite>. In this paper, we will explain how we integrate the two into a CAPSGAN. Due to many deficits in how CNN's
    work, for example in how a face with noses all over is not necessarily recognized as out of the norm, CapsNet's were
    created to deal with some of these. Additionally, CNN's lack the ability to be rotationally invariant, something capsule
    nets are able to accomplish due to their use of vectors as activations rather than scalars..

  <h4>GAN</h4>
  <p>Generative adversarial networks are a model used to generate images from a learned distribution. They are composed of two
    components: a generator that learns to generate images given a vector sampled from the latent distribution, and a discriminator
    that learns to discriminate between generated images and real ones from the dataset. The two components of this model
    play a minimax game, by the end of which the generator is able to generate images from the data distribution by randomly
    sampling from the latent space. Traditionally, architecutres such as a deep convolutional neural network are used for
    both components, but we propose using a capsule network for the discriminator.</p>
